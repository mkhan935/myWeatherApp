# myWeatherApp
using Django, and deployed to heroku

The purpose of this project was 

1. To Make a Django Application that takes The ZipCode and OutPuts the weather related to that ZIP

I hate ads on the yahoo's weather site, so I decided to make this for fun

2. The part that was new to me is learning how to deploy it on to Heroku

On these files I have gotten rid of the API keys, and db passwords, use your own.
