# myWeatherApp
using Django, and deployed to heroku

The purpose of this project was 

1. To Make a Django Application that takes The ZipCode and OutPuts the weather related to that ZIP
  Used PostgreSQL as a local databse and used it for Heroku also as Heroku let's us use one for free.

I hate ads on the yahoo's weather site, so I decided to make this for fun

 2. The part that was new to me is learning how to deploy it on to Heroku
 
 http://adfreeweatherapp.herokuapp.com/ thats the link, hopefully it still works.

On these files I have gotten rid of the API keys, and db passwords, use your own.

I know bootstrap/css/html but I've always sucked at art, don't judge my desgin :)
